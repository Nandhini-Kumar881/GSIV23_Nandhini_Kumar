# Movie Browser App

## Instructions

To run and test the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Obtain an API key from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key: `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`.
5. Run the app locally using `npm start`.
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

To run unit tests:

1. Run `npm test` to execute Jest-based unit tests.
2. Run `npm run test-dom` to execute React Testing Library based DOM tests.

## Elements Demonstrating Proficiency

1. **Redux State Management:** Utilized Redux to manage the application's state, ensuring a predictable and centralized source of truth for data.
2. **API Integration:** Integrated the TMDb API to fetch and display movie data.
3. **Routing:** Implemented routing using React Router to navigate between List and Details pages.
4. **Responsive Design:** Developed a responsive design with a minimum width of 512 pixels to ensure compatibility across various devices.
5. **Infinite Scrolling:** Implemented infinite scrolling on the List page to enhance user experience.
6. **UI Components:** Created reusable UI components such as MovieCard to maintain code modularity.

These elements showcase my proficiency in front-end development, state management, API integration, and responsive design.

## Improvements with Additional Time

If I had more time, I would:

1. **Improve Testing:** Extend test coverage for reducers, actions, and UI components, ensuring comprehensive code quality checks.
2. **Implement Error Handling:** Enhance error handling and display meaningful error messages when API requests fail.
3. **Optimize Performance:** Implement memoization and consider using libraries like Reselect to optimize Redux selectors.
4. **Implement PWA Features:** Convert the app into a Progressive Web App (PWA) to enable offline access and improve user experience.
5. **Enhance Styling:** Polish the UI, refine styles, and ensure consistent visual elements across the app.

These improvements would enhance the app's stability, performance, and user experience.

## Feedback

The challenge is well-structured and comprehensive, covering various aspects of modern web development. However, providing more specific guidance on setting up Redux, API integration, and styling would be beneficial for candidates who are new to these concepts.
